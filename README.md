# livebokeh
Simpler bokeh for dynamic data

The usecase livebokeh is focusing on is displaying, upon (webbrowser's) request, a dynamic view of the datamodel.

livebokeh aims at taking care of a maximum of bokeh interfacing details for this usecase
so that a livebokeh's users can "just plug-in" livebokeh into his code and visually see his data evolve over time.

## Usage
This is still being developed, the interface hasn't been decided just yet...
livebokeh relies on pandas for the datastorage and, obviously, bokeh for display.
No other dependency should be needed... 

## development
This is just a small package written to help debug data processing code.
So lets keep this as simple as possible.

Think about a useful situation that livebokeh doesnt support yet ? post an issue.
Found a bug ? post an issue.
Have anything else you wanna talk about ? post an issue.
Hope this can save you some time...
